Exercise 4
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

number = int(input("Give me a number: "))

x = range(1, (number + 1))

for i in x:
    if (number % i) == 0:
        print(i)
