Trying out all exercises in practicepython.org. Wish me luck!

Exercise 1
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

Extras:

Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

P/s: adding extra line of code to test if the input is valid before proceeding to run the code.

Exercise 2 
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

Extras:

If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

P/s: adding extra line of code to test if the input is valid before proceeding to run the code.

Exercise 3 
Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:

Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
Write this in one line of Python.
Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

Exercise 4 
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

Exercise 5 
Take two lists, say for example these two:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

Extras:

Randomly generate two lists to test this
Write this in one line of Python (don’t worry if you can’t figure this out at this point - we’ll get to it soon)
